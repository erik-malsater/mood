# mood
Mood is a personal project where I've created a prototype for an online artwork community. 
To create this site I've used SASS, jQuery, PHP and SQL. 
My goal was to implement what I've learnt so far about building accessible, 
responsive and dynamic web applications and further explore what you can create using jQuery functions.
